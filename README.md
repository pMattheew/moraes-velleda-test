# Green Garden
#### Admissional test for "Moraes & Velleda" company

## ðŸš€ Run the project

- You can try the project for yourself with _just one click_ using a [Gitpod workspace](https://gitpod.io/#/github.com/pmattheew/moraes-velleda-test); 
  
  It will setup everything and start the development server just for you =)

- It's possible that while opening for the first time the start script doesn't execute properly, for this, follow these steps:

1. Create a database running this command:
```
mysql -u root -e "create database greengarden_db"
```
2. Start Laravel development server running this command:
```
npm run laravel.host # must be hosted in cloud environment.
```
